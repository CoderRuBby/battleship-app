# Battleship! The Game! (WIP)

## Description
This is a remake of a Battleship game I made while completing the Odin project.<br/>
You can view that version [HERE](https://github.com/CoderRuBby/project-battleship/tree/main).

This remake will be created using:
- TDD (Test Driven Development)
- Vite
- Vitest
- React and React Router v7
- Typescript
- Tailwind

### Why the remake?
Short answer: to make an application showing my knowledge and skills as a developer.<br/>

If you browse the original Battleship game code you will quickly see just how messy and unorganized it is.
Essentially a giant plate of spaghetti! I wanted to correct this. I also wanted to utulize the component-based
architecture that React has to offer which makes creating a ui extremely efficient and dare I say fun? One other
key thing I have been wanting to do is complete a project from start to finsih with Test Driven Development (TDD).
The original version of Battleship started in development with TDD, however about halfway through the development,
TDD was abandoned due to my inexperince with testing.
